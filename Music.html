	    Cuban music, including its instruments, performances and dances, contains a variety of unique traditions, mainly influenced by West African and European (especially Spanish) music. [1] Due to the convergent nature of most genres, Cuban music is often considered one of the richest and most influential regional music in the world. For example, Son Cubano blends arrangements of Spanish guitar (tres), melody, harmony and lyrical traditions with Afro-Cuban percussion and rhythm. Few traces of the original Aboriginal traditions have been left since the extinction of the Aboriginal peoples in the 16th century.
